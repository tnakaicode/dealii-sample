# This page contains a link to every notebook as well as a short explanation on what the notebooks do.
# 
# ## tutorial-1
# [tutorial-1](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/tree/master/contrib/python-bindings/notebooks/tutorial-1.ipynb) shows how to create a **Triangulation** using the python binding. We also show how to refine the grid, merge two **Triangulations**, and finally how to output the **Triangulation** so that it can be loaded in a C++ code.
# 
# ## step-49
# [step-49](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/tree/master/examples/step-49/step-49.ipynb) shows how to import, create and transform various meshes using a variety of built-in functions.
# 
# ## step-53
# [step-53](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/tree/master/examples/step-53/step-53.ipynb) shows how to describe complex geometrices using manifolds. 
# 
# ## step-62
# [step-62](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/tree/master/examples/step-62/step-62.ipynb) shows how to calculate the [energy band gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap) and the
# mechanical resonance of a [micropillar superlattice cavity](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033813).
